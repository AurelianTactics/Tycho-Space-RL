### Tycho Space RL: Gymnasium Environment and Stand-alone Pygame

*This code was mostly written with GitHub Copilot in December of 2024 using GPT 4o and Sonnet 3.5 preview. Main goal was to see how well the Copilot Edits feature works while programming.*

*Tycho Space RL is a simple turn-based game. Each player starts with one star. The winner is the one who captures all of his opponent's stars. This is a turn-based game where players simultaneously enter their moves.*

#### Goals:
- Create a Gymnasium-compliant environment
- Can also be played as a standalone game
- Trying out new Copilot and AI coding functionality
- Have AI coding tools do as much of the works as possible.
- Uploaded, distributable, and installable through test.pypi.org

#### Backlog
- As the main goals of this project have been met, I will likely not revisit for a bit. Some rough items to work on if I decide to pick up on the project are in archive/backlog.txt
