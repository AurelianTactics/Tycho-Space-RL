### Tycho Space RL: Gymnasium Environment and Stand-alone Pygame
*Tycho Space RL is a simple turn-based game. Each player starts with one star. The winner is the one who captures all of his opponent's stars. This is a turn-based game where players simultaneously enter their moves.*

#### Goals:
- Create a Gymnasium-compliant environment
- Can also be played as a standalone game
- Trying out new Copilot and AI coding tools
- Goal is to have those tools do as much of the work as possible
